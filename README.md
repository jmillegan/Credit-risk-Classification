# Credit-risk-Classification
I would first like to have you take note that this challenge did not match the key or the Challenge instructions according to William my TA.  You will find in my notebook, there is a notation of where the homework continued, but was not part of the challenge instuctions, nor was it in the key when William and I went through it line by line.  Also the report template in the Challenge material has a header of Module 12 and this is 20, so I found this confusing at first as well.


The purpose of the analysis is to identify the credit worthiness of borrowers.  We used the loan amounts being requested, their loan to debt ratio with thier income, as well as the number current loans and the loan amount.  Using all this information were able to drill down to an overview of how many borrowers were canidates for loans.
By getting the value counts of the two identifiers of the loan status, we are able to compare those in the '0' and '1' catagory with true number counts.
Using Logistic Regression, a random state of just one, and using the balanced accuacy of the loan status to the other catogories, we will be able to get a view of what percentage of our borrowers will be credit worthy.
## Results


I concluded:
     Predicted we were going to be 100% accruate in our evaluation for those in the 0 catagory of loan status with a value count of 75k.
     Predicted as well as a very impressive number of 87% for those in the '1' catatory of loan status with a value count of 2500. 
     This is a good tool to use to predict the outcome.

Using this type of model to verify credit worthiness is proving to be a useful tool.  The accuracy of determing those who should be considered were high numbers and should be reviewed as a success.
